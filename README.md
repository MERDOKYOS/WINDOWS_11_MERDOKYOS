# Windows11-SystemProgramming-Documentation

## Documentation Description

This project provides a detailed guide for installing and configuring Windows 11 in a virtualized environment
using tools like VirtualBox or VMware. It walks through system requirements, ISO download, virtualization settings,
disk partitioning, and post-installation setup. The objective is to help users especially students and professionals get a
stable Windows 11 environment for learning system-level programming, security testing, or application development.
The guide follows best practices to ensure a clean, performant, and secure installation.

## System-Call Description

This project also explores the use of the mlock() system call in C, which locks a processâ€™s memory pages into RAM,
preventing them from being paged to swap. This is crucial for high-security applications that handle sensitive data
, as it ensures the data stays in RAM and never touches disk. A minimal C programis provided to demonstrate how mlock()
works, its return values, and how to handle potential permission-related errors. This example serves as an entry point 
to learning low-level memory management andsecurity best practices in system programming.
